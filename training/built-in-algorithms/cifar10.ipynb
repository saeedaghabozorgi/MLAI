    "Welcome to our example of image classification algorithm. In this notebook, we will use the Amazon sagemaker image classification algorithm to train on the [cifar10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "The Amazon SageMaker image classification algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm that supports multi-label classification. It takes an image as input and outputs one or more labels assigned to that image. It uses a convolutional neural network (ResNet) that can be trained from scratch or trained using transfer learning when a large number of training images are not available.\n",

The user can also provide the image files as input, which will be converted into `RecordIO` format using MXNet's [im2rec](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/how_to/recordio.html?highlight=im2rec) tool. For this demo, we will use record io format of the training and validation dataset. \n",

    "* **num_layers**: The number of layers (depth) for the network. We use 18 in this samples but other values such as 50, 152 can be used. \n",
    "* **num_training_samples**: This is the total number of training samples. It is set to 50000 for cifar10 dataset with the current split\n",

    "* **epochs**: Number of training epochs\n",
    "* **learning_rate**: Learning rate for training\n",
    "* **mini_batch_size**: The number of training samples used for each mini batch. In distributed training, the number of training samples used per batch will be N * mini_batch_size where N is the number of hosts on which training is run"
