    "## Using experiment\n",
    "This notebook shows how to train a Keras Sequential model on SageMaker, and use SageMaker Experiment Management Python SDK to organize, track, compare, and evaluate your machine learning (ML) model training experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can track artifacts for experiments, including data sets, algorithms, hyper-parameters, and metrics. Experiments executed on SageMaker such as SageMaker Autopilot jobs and training jobs will be automatically tracked. You can also track artifacts for additional steps within an ML workflow that come before/after model training e.g. data pre-processing or post-training model evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The APIs also let you search and browse your current and past experiments, compare experiments, and identify best performing models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model used for this notebook is a simple deep CNN that was extracted from [the Keras examples](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/cifar10_cnn.py). The experiment will be organized as follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download and prepare the cifar10 dataset.\n",
    "2. Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model. Tune the hyper parameter that configures the optimization method in the model. Track the parameter configurations and resulting model accuracy using SageMaker Experiments Python SDK.\n",
    "3. Finally use the search and analytics capabilities of Python SDK to search, compare and evaluate the performance of all model versions generated from model tuning in Step 2.\n",
    "4. We will also see an example of tracing the complete linage of a model version i.e. the collection of all the data pre-processing and training configurations and inputs that went into creating that model version."
